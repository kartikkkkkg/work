# Project Plan: Report Management Portal Wireframes and UI Design

## Overall Project Goal
To create comprehensive wireframes and UI designs for a Report Management Portal, based on the provided user story backlog. This will involve translating functional requirements into visual layouts and interactive elements.

## Pages to be Designed
Based on the user stories, the following pages will need to be designed:

1.  **Login Page:** (Implied by the need for user access and portal interaction)
2.  **Landing Page/Dashboard:** (Implied by US05 - notifications in the portal, and general portal interaction)
3.  **Report Listing/Search Page:** (Implied by US05 - search button, and US06 - list of reports with pagination)
4.  **Report Details/Download Page:** (Implied by US06 - download report for a specific period)
5.  **Admin User Management Page:** (Implied by US04 - provide access to user groups)
6.  **File Transfer/Configuration Page:** (Implied by US01, US02, US03 - managing file transfers and configurations)

## Step-by-Step Process for Wireframing and UI Design

### Phase 1: Analyze Project Scope and Create Detailed Design Plan (Current Phase)
*   **Objective:** Define the project scope, identify key pages, and outline the design process.
*   **Action:** This step is currently being completed by outlining this document.

### Phase 2: Research UI Patterns and Design References
*   **Objective:** Gather inspiration and best practices for UI/UX design relevant to report management portals, login flows, and dashboards.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Search for examples of effective login pages, secure authentication flows, and user-friendly dashboards.
    *   Look for UI patterns related to data tables, search functionalities, filtering, and report downloading.
    *   Identify potential design systems or style guides that could inform the visual design.

### Phase 3: Create Wireframes for Login and Landing Pages
*   **Objective:** Develop low-fidelity wireframes for the core entry points of the application: the Login Page and the main Landing Page/Dashboard.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Login Page Wireframe:** Sketch out the layout for username/password input, login button, forgot password link, and any branding elements.
    *   **Landing Page/Dashboard Wireframe:** Based on US05, include areas for notifications, a search bar, and a general layout for displaying key information or quick access to reports.
    *   Focus on functionality and information hierarchy rather than visual aesthetics.

### Phase 4: Create Wireframes for Remaining Pages
*   **Objective:** Develop low-fidelity wireframes for the remaining identified pages.
*   **Actions:**
    *   **Report Listing/Search Page Wireframe:** Design the layout for search input, filters (e.g., date range for US06), a table or list to display reports with pagination, and potentially a download button.
    *   **Report Details/Download Page Wireframe:** Outline how report details will be presented and the mechanism for downloading reports (e.g., date selection for US06).
    *   **Admin User Management Page Wireframe:** Sketch out elements for managing user groups, assigning roles, and viewing user details (based on US04).
    *   **File Transfer/Configuration Page Wireframe:** Design interfaces for configuring file transfer paths, viewing transfer status, and managing attributes (based on US01, US02, US03).

### Phase 5: Design UI Mockups Based on Wireframes
*   **Objective:** Transform the approved wireframes into high-fidelity UI mockups, incorporating visual design elements, branding, and detailed interactions.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Apply a consistent visual style, including color palettes, typography, and iconography.
    *   Create detailed mockups for all wireframed pages, ensuring all UI components are clearly defined.
    *   Consider responsive design principles to ensure the interface adapts to different screen sizes.
    *   Refine interactions and visual feedback for user actions.

### Phase 6: Deliver Complete Wireframes and UI Designs to User
*   **Objective:** Present the finalized wireframes and UI mockups to the user for review and approval.
*   **Actions:**
    *   Compile all wireframes and UI mockups into a clear, presentable format.
    *   Provide any necessary explanations or design rationale.
    *   Gather feedback for potential iterations.

This detailed plan will guide our progress. We will start with Phase 2 after this plan is delivered.
